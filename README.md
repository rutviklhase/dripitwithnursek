A website I made based on client's requirements. 

## About the website:
The website was made with client's business of IV Drip Therapy in mind. It has multiple components like the Home Page, Locations Page, Services Page and the Bookings Redirect.

###Technical Overview:
It uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Under the hood, it uses ReactJS in conjuction to various extensions like MongoDB, ExpressJs, LeafletJs, Axios. 

The front-end uses an API backend which is created using ExpressJS and Axios. 
The API is mostly used to pull data from a MongoDB Atlas database and then render it out on the Services page.

###Development Environment:
1) Run `NPM INSTALL` inside the /dripitwithnursek folder.

2) Run `NPM START` inside the /driptitwithnursek folder.

3) In order to start the backend Web API use VSCODE's inbuilt Run and Debug button.In case VSCODE is unable to start it properly, navigate to the /servicesapi folder inside your terminal and run `node index.js`.
